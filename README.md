# Kagiso-Local-Job-Board-Demo
Kagiso Local Job Board is a lightweight, offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to connect residents of Kagiso, Krugersdorp, and nearby areas with local job opportunities.

Users can:
- Post available jobs, specifying the category (e.g. Retail, Construction, Cleaning) and area (e.g. Kagiso Ext 2, Munsieville, Krugersdorp CBD).
- View current job listings and easily contact employers via phone or email.
- Filter by category or area to quickly find relevant jobs.
- Report jobs that have been filled, which are automatically removed after 3 reports to keep listings current.

Admins can:
- Securely log into an admin dashboard with a hashed password for local-only management.
- View all job postings in a structured table.
- Mark jobs as filled or delete outdated or inappropriate listings.

Features:
- 🌙 Dark mode toggle for comfortable viewing.
- 🔒 SHA-256 secure admin login.
- 📅 Auto-removes job listings after 20 days to keep content fresh.
- 🛠️ Fully offline-capable with service worker caching (PWA).
- 📱 Mobile-friendly, responsive design that feels like a native app.
- ⚠ Built-in disclaimers to promote safe community interactions.

This project is tailored for small communities to empower local employment without relying on expensive platforms or internet access.
